    "\n",
    "A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is **order-preserving** if, for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, whenever $x \\leq y$, it also follows that $f(x) \\leq f(y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms:\n",
    "- If one number is less than or equal to another number, an order-preserving function will ensure that the output of the first number (under the function) is also less than or equal to the output of the second number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of an Order-Preserving Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function $f(x) = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is $f(x) = x$ order-preserving?**  \n",
    "  If $x \\leq y$, then directly, $f(x) \\leq f(y)$.  \n",
    "  Since the function just outputs the input itself, the order between any two numbers $x$ and $y$ is maintained. Therefore, $f(x) = x$ is order-preserving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Function That Is Not Order-Preserving\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function \\( f(x) = -x \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is $f(x) = -x$ not order-preserving?**  \n",
    "  Let's test this with specific values:\n",
    "  - Choose $x = 1$ and $y = 2$. Clearly, $x \\leq y$ (since $1 \\leq 2$).\n",
    "  - Now compute $f(x)$ and $f(y)$:\n",
    "    $f(x) = -1, f(y) = -2$\n",
    "  - Compare $f(x)$ and $f(y)$:  \n",
    "    $-1 \\not\\leq -2$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Therefore, $f(x) = -x$ does **not** preserve the order because although $1 \\leq 2$, the outputs are $-1$ and $-2$, where $-1$ is **not** less than or equal to $-2$. This violates the condition for being order-preserving. \n"
